All written in R.

Pendulum: Analyze the swinging pendulum data in time series by write a damped sinusoid model to replicate the original
pendulum data and use autoregressive model to forecast a variable by using regression against itself.

Stock: Analyze the stock data on December, 5, 2014 by using single/double exponential smoothing, Holt-Winters, and
selecting an ARIMA model to forecast the following n-periods.

CO2-Weekly: Analyze the weekly carbon dioxide data using Holt-Winters and selecting an ARIMA model to forecast the following n-periods.

Background Radioactivity: Analyze the covariance stationary time series data to explore the statistical patterns by using the moving averages smoothing, observing lagged scatterplot to indicate autocorrelation, testing hypotheses tests, writing a moving average model to analyze forecast errors, and selecting an ARIMA model to forecast the following n-periods.

Daily Sunspot Number & CO2-Weekly: Compare both data sets by exploring frequency methods.
